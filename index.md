## Hello.

I’m an IT engineer in Washington, D.C., responsible for thousands of Mac and Windows endpoints. I earned my B.S. in Cybersecurity while being a stay-at-home dad for my first son.

At home I enjoy playing with my two boys, reading, personal finance, Magic: The Gathering, dreaming about space, and exploring spatial computing with Apple Vision Pro ᯅ.

## Things I think about:

I’m passionate about digital privacy, favoring tech and services that align with those values, and I support open-source projects. I’m focused on digital preservation, with a robust backup plan for my personal data and media to ensure it’s accessible for my family forever.

Information security has fascinated me since childhood, when I taught myself Visual Basic to tweak AOL’s client. I’ve been reading 2600 since 2001 and published an article in the Winter 2007-2008 issue.

I’m increasingly engaging with AI, always eager to try the latest innovations. Right now, I’m enjoying ChatGPT and Grok the most for their capabilities and insights.

Sustainable energy and water infrastructure are big interests. I advocate for expanding U.S. nuclear power and investing in water desalination and purification.

I believe in a strong public space program, with NASA leading humanity’s journey beyond Earth, complemented by private innovators like SpaceX.

I drive an electric vehicle (EV), which I see as key to sustainable transportation. EVs cut emissions, offer smooth drives, and save me about $700 yearly charging at home. Advances in battery tech and charging infrastructure make them increasingly practical.
